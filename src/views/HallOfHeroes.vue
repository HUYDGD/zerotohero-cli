          With hard work and continuous effort learning the Mandarin language,
          many have improved tremendously. In this page we showcase some of our
          students that have successfully passed the HSK exams after taking
          courses from us!
        </p>
        <p>
          If you have taken our courses and have passed an HSK test (either an
          official test or a self-test), you can add your name to the scoreboard
          by filling out
